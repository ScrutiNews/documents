# Purpose, Audience, and Disclaimers:

### Purpose: 
The purpose of this document is to garner interest and support from people who wish to contribute to the software development and business launch of the proposed 'ScrutiNews' project.

### Intended Audience: 
This proposal will be shared with a range of people whom I feel would have something to contribute, and I think might be interested in the concept.

### From Order to Chaos:
I'll face the inevitable, but necessary, discomfort of moving from order to chaos as I move from the nicely ordered act of putting initial thoughts down on paper, to inviting opinion, critique, and feedback of others, but without this step, the project will go nowhere...

### Confidentiality:
Please refrain from sharing this document without the explicit permission of the author. Ultimately the project will be conducted with maximum openness and transparency, but in the short-term, prior to an agreed plan to execute on the ideas herein, I insist on discretion in all matters relating to this proposal.

### Disclaimer:
Nothing within this document constitutes a commitment or any promise of a legal nature, it is purely to gauge interest and garner support. It is not intended as a polished business document, sloppy thinking, typos, or grammatical quirks may lurk here. Should interest and support be sufficient, a more formal association of collaborators will be created with clear terms of engagement.

### Copyright: 
Copyrighted by John Durrant. This document or any part of this document is not to be copied, distributed, or re-used outside of the the purposes of collaborating with the team associated with this project.
