# 6. Guiding Principles:
We will strive for elegance, simplicity, inclusiveness, honesty, and transparency in the way we go about building the platform. These are nice, warm, and fuzzy words so what do they mean in reality? A set of guiding principles should be defined so that we have something to pull us back to when things go awry. Our principles should be the antithesis of the world we are looking to scrutinise. Look at how political discourse is done, how mass media can lie and manipulate, how social media stirs up hated, and do the opposite.

Our guiding principles should guide is in the way we code, the way we communicate with each other and the outside world, and the way we do dispute resolution. If we are to honestly scrutinise and critique broadcast content, we should put ourselves beyond suspicion in the way we conduct our affairs.

#### Open Source? 
Can this project be done as an open source project, gaining the benefit of mass collaboration, while still maintaining the commercial viability should the source code be forked to launch competitors? If the project, as a whole, should not be open sourced, could it be broken down into open source modules?
