# 4. How. Platform and Features: 
#### The diagram below depicts the main activities and workflow of the proposed ScrutiNews platform:

The diagram above depicts a basic workflow within the ScrutiNews platform. We take feed inputs via RSS (Really Simple Syndication) and hand picked news items. Scrutineers break them down into core elements so they can be evaluated, analysed, and simplified in ways that are meaningful to a variation of personal tastes. An especially created cryptocurrency micro-payments token is used to incentivise the Scrutineers and to take payments to support the revenue model (The Bitcoin icon was used above, but in actuality there would be something like ScrutiCoin)

The sections below elaborate on this basic diagram:

### 4.1 News Sourcing:

Collect News from Various Feed Sources: The vast majority of news oriented websites provide RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds. RSS has been around in various forms since the 90's and provides information in a computer readable format (XML) so that online content from one website can be syndicated to another website. In addition to news sites is also possible to create RSS feeds from Blogs, YouTube and Twitter channels.

a) We automatically collect feeds from designated news sources: We maintain a Database of sources, and categorise those sources so they can be managed and channelled based on user interest.

b) User added feeds: A user suggests an ad-hoc article or other content for inclusion in the pot of aggregated content.

### 4.2 Feed Screening:

Grouping Common Feed Articles into Single 'Story Collections': When a new article is supplied via a feed, ScrutiNews needs to decide whether this is a completely new story for today, or whether we have already covered the story from an alternative source.

#### Automated Feed Screening: 
Use keywords and intelligent algorithms to match incoming feeds to pre-existing stories of the day, providing a suggested pick list for (b) below.

#### Human Feed Screening:
Use human judgement to determine the relevance and value of the feed and link it to any preexisting stories of the day based on a suggested list produced from (a) above.

* GuestUsers will be periodically prompted to do Feed Screening in order to avoid being locked out. They provide a quick screening service taking up several seconds in return for continued access. A cookie will be placed on their device to allow us to rate their efforts and determine whether they are being genuine.
* Logged-in Users can voluntarily agree to do Feed Screening, setting a threshold for how many they do, in return for cryptocurrency micro-payments.

This will enable readers to view a single story container, which is collection of individual articles reporting on the single story.

### 4.3 Scrutineers:
Applying Scrutiny, Analysis, Perspectives, Clarity, and Editorial Synopsis to 'Story Collections': A significant difference between ScrutiNews and other RSS Feed Readers, is the means to provide reliable analysis so a user can quickly gain a balanced insight into a story without trawling through unreliable and biased articles.

#### a) Scrutineers are Paid Via Cryptocurrency Micro-payments Token to Scrutinise Content: 
A lot of people spend a lot of time reading news articles and commenting about them on social media. As a Scrutineer they would have access to training sources to sharpen their critical thinking and a methodology and tools to dissect content and improve their analytical skills. They will be paid for their efforts via a cryptocurrency micro-payments token.

ScrutiNews will include tools enable Scrutineers to collaborate on breaking down an article to its core elements upon which to provide scrutiny and analysis.

#### Scrutineers will Collaborate to: 
* Break a feed article down to its core elements
* Identify premises and conclusions, whether implicit or explicit
* Vote on Premises for their factual validity
* Identify sources and assess their credibility 
* Identify fallacious arguments and bias
* Look for conflicts of interest and hidden agendas
* Identify context, and missing context 
* Cut through rhetoric, and tease out the crux of the message
* Identify exaggeration and sensationalism

#### Scrutiny Methodology: 
The development of a methodology to scrutinise content will be an ever-evolving practice, building, tweaking, learning and refining the methodology as a community. There will be pros and cons with different approaches, some will be clear and easy to apply, without much debate, other approaches may be contentious or ambiguous. Our methodology will be transparent, and itself open to scrutiny.

#### Scrutineer Rewards:
Users will vote on the scrutiny provided, which will determine how much a Scrutineer is paid for their work. A Scrutineer can improve their weighted potential earnings by regularly attending 'Scrutineer University', A range of online course designed in collaboration with experts in critical thinking to help with identifying, categorising and analysing fallacious reporting .

### 4.4 Added Features:
Below are some ideas to be added to the platform as part of a potential roadmap:

#### Ratings for Journalists, and Media Publications: 
Through the scrutiny process, we will begin to be able to rate individual journalists and whole publications by a number of metrics. Unveiling the bad and celebrating the good, exposing trends in their bias along the spectrum of viewpoints (E.g. Politically left or right leaning - or more appropriate categorisations).

#### Guides to Argumentation:
Within the platform there will be guides for all users in the 'art of argumentation', so that users become adept at spotting well constructed arguments from bad and deliberately manipulative arguments. Users will be able to tag content to call out abuses of argumentation strategy (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies) and recognising where cognitive bias may be be a factor (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases). When content is tagged, others will be able to vote on the accuracy and applicability of the tag.

The point of ScrutiNews, and a major attraction to users, is that through exposure to well constructed arguments, open-mindedness,

#### People, Concepts, Themes, and Arguments:
The will be people, concepts, themes, and arguments which come up time and time again in news stories. ScrutiNews will tag and categories these as entities which can be scrutinised on their own merits/demerits so that we build up an understanding of these entities and how they relate to the stories they are involved with, giving us a more rounded perspective interrelating parts.

We can provide sub analysis, for example under the 'People' category, we can try to understand a person's personality, what drives them to act the way they do, what bearing does this have on the events they're involved with?

For concepts and themes, we can crowdsource input into definitions, bringing clarity and highlighting ambiguities in viewpoints, so when the same concepts and themes reoccur in future stories, we have the foundations of rational discourse.

For arguments we can highlight their inherent logic, their premises, and conclusions.

#### Spectrum of Viewpoints:
“Tyranny is the deliberate removal of nuance” - Albert Maysles. Mass media reporting often deliberately remove nuance from a story, painting it in black-and-white terms according to their agenda or whatever bias held by their readership. ScrutiNews aims to show all the nuances.

One of the pieces of content produced by Scrutineers will be a taxonomy or categorisation of viewpoints around a particular issue. We want to expose the nuances, the shades of grey around an issue, analysing and understanding what justifications are used to support different viewpoints.

We should not shy away from looking at all viewpoints on an issue, from the unpalatable farright, or far-left views, to the mainstream perspectives, as well as what some may see as weird 'conspiracy theories'. Exploring range of 'reality tunnels' people apply to reach their view of the truth.

#### Viewpoint Profiling and Aggregation: 
The job of ScrutiNews to explore the perspectives and understand the justifications people use to support their beliefs, and expose the evidence, or lack thereof, in their justifications. After creating the spectrum of opinion, mentioned in the previous section, it would be interesting to take votes from users on where they feel they sit on the spectrum.

Self-voted alignment with specific viewpoints could be aggregated to wider populations to assess public opinion and sentiment.

#### Rate the Scrutiny, not the Person: 
Scrutiny and commentary will be anonymised when initially published, so users will vote and rate on the accuracy and usefulness of the contribution, rather than due to a like or dislike of the person behind the contribution. Their identities will be revealed after the passage of a certain amount of time (to be determined, e.g. unveiling a contributor's identity after one day of anonymity, or one week). Anyone proven to be secretly revealing their identity prior to unveiling would be penalised.

This would be a unique feature with interesting consequences. No longer are we led by the popular or loudest voice, but by an impartial assessment of the most accurate or interesting voice, giving unknown or new contributors as much weight and power as the more established ones.

#### Highly Shareable Summary Content: 
The output of all the news filtering and Scrutineering will be concise and easily understandable snapshots of a news item which can easily be shared across social media platforms. Whenever a debate on social media gets out of hand, abusive, or just plain stupid, a 'share' from ScrutiNews will provide facts, evidence, analysis of alternative viewpoints and clarity. Social sharing of trusted high-quality content would be the catalyst for exponential interest and support for the ScrutiNews platform.

#### Broadcast Video Content:
Video content may also be considered as a means of making the daily scrutinised news events both a highly accessible and a highly shareable phenomenon. ScrutiNews could provide multiple channels on video sharing websites such as YouTube and DTube for Video Journalists to report on the day's scrutinised events. People watch a ScrutiNews video round-up of how the today's news was reported, highlighting the truths, and untruths.

#### Ratings 'Badges' for Source Content Providers:
Publications of integrity, who adhere to a more principled journalism, who strive for the truth, would have the option of displaying a ScrutiNews rating for individual articles and the publication as a whole. This would be a bold step by a news outlet but adds an extra dimension of reassurance that they are treating their readers with respectful decency, rather than treating like idiots, solely as cannon fodder for their advertisers.

#### Pearls of Wisdom:
Whenever a user illuminates an issue through inspired insight, or concisely describes a difficult concept, it may be nominated by users as a Pearl of Wisdom, making it visible and available when the issue or concept is relevant to a Story.

#### Aim of all Features: 
The whole aim of the ScruitiNews platform is to strip out bias, bullshit, ambiguities, and complications from news items and distil them down into chunks of analysis so that everyday people have access to clear and concise analysis on the important events of the day, improving people's awareness of how to critically filter information, and exposing the credibility of journalists, media outlets, and information provided on the web.
