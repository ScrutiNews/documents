# 9. Roadmap:

This will be an evolving concept which will grow through collaborative thinking and feedback. Of course we have to start with baby steps, but the roadmap is needed to ensure those baby steps take us to where we want to go.

#### Key points could include:
* Distributed architecture, avoiding attacks and encouraging availability in repressive regimes. 
* Internationalisation, multi-languages - it's useful to see how the same story is reported in different countries. 
* Cryptocurrency token based economic system to support and incentivise activity on the platform. 
* A ScrutiNews 'Foundation' to ensure principled governance so that the platform is guaranteed independent, transparent, and incorruptible. 
* Guides, tutorials, and tools enabling detailed scrutiny and analysis. 
* Meta-analysis and statistics on the credibility of media platforms and individual journalists. 
* APIs for syndicated distribution of ScrutiNews daily outputs. 
* Expand scrutiny methodology to any other applicable content (chapters in books, blogs, Wikipedia pages, documentaries, interviews with politicians, advertising, political manifestos etc.). 
* ScrutiNews video media channels, providing high quality daily synopsis and analysis. 
* Timestamped immutable blockchain storage of cryptographically hashed articles to avoid articles disappearing down an Orwellian 'memory hole' where text is altered, and old versions destroyed.

Note: As per the intro to this section, I don't have all the answers â€“ this document is about getting thoughts and ideas down onto paper so that with other contributors we can co-create the roadmap.
