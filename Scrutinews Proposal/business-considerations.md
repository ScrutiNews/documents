# 8. Business Considerations

### 8.1 Funding and Proposed ICO:
The inputs to any venture are labour and capital. It is hoped that labour will initially come from enthusiastic and talented colleagues, or contacts we make along the way, leading to capital investment via an ICO (Initial Coin Offering - see https://cointelegraph.com/explained/icoexplained). The ICO will create funds to reward the enthusiasm of the early contributors of labour inputs and create a viable framework for continued product development.

This will start as a bootstrapped project for building a prototype, with any minimal funding requirements provided by those key participants with access to funds. The ICO will provide an allocation for ongoing funding according to a roadmap, complemented by a subscriptions and syndication based revenue model (E.g. Subscribers to the platform and feed services).

A successful ICO will require a competent and believable team, a realistic and motivating roadmap, a well written whitepaper, a secure and properly constructed smart contract for collecting ICO funds, transparent and principled approach to governance, and an authentic voice in everything we do to create excellent public relations.

Some ICOs have raised a huge amount of funds, capitalising on the excitement and exuberance of the cryptocurrency scene. It's common to see ICOs reaching several $million in a very short time.

### 8.2 Business and Revenue Models:
It is envisioned that ScrutiNews would launch as a private commercial organisation, with the aim of becoming commercially viable through a range of possible revenue models.

a) Subscription Revenues: 
* A premium subscription service would provide users with an enhanced experience over guest users. For example, the Guest User experience will be interrupted with requests.

b) Licensing / Syndicating ScrutiNews content: 
* The re-use of ScrutiNews output via licensing/syndicating to third parties. Should a mainstream news organisation wish to use our content, there would be a licensing fee.

c) Scrutiny 'bounties' offered to review content:
* When a content creator, such as the marketing/PR division of a company, wants to communicate to its audience in a sincere and authentic voice, it may wish to run its content through the Scrutineers to reveal any unintended holes in its communication. The bounty would be a fee denominated in the ScrutiNews cryptocurrency token. The higher the bounty offered, the more attention from Scrutineers as they compete to provide the best scrutiny. 
* It's possible that the 'bounty' concept could be where a media outlet, particularly proud of a published article, paying to have it thoroughly scrutinised, thereby enhancing its audience appeal, or paying to have a rival's article run through the scrutiny mill in order to expose a lack of diligence.

d) Advertising: 
* Advertising is a common revenue mechanism, however a platform aiming to reduce bias and manipulation should probably avoid advertising and remain completely impartial. Advertising as a source of revenue should only be considered if it does not create a conflict of interest.

### 8.3 Target Market:
> “There are three classes of people: Those who see. Those who see when they are shown. Those who do not see.” - Leonardo Da Vinci

The Leonado Da Vinci quote conveniently segments the potential user market for us:

a) Those who see: 
* These are the Scrutineers, intelligent and erudite people interested in sharing their insight to improve broader understanding and public discourse. Let’s say 20% of the user audience.

b) Those who see when they are shown: 
* This will make up the clear majority of the use base, let's say 80%. These are people who want to learn, who want to improve their understanding of the world, who know they're often being lied to and manipulated by the media and want to filter fact from fiction.

c) Those who do not see:
* Those who do not see will experience ScrutiNews when they are being abusive or idiotic in online debates. An enlightened ScrutiNews user will post a clear 'shareable' ScrutiNews summary of the knowns and unknowns, and the spectrum of viewpoints on the given issue and hopefully the prejudiced and inaccurate line of attack will be shown up for what it is, and the culprit will back down. Of course, we don't want to attract mindless idiots, entrenched in their bitter prejudices, with their mind closed to alternative viewpoints. Such users should be ostracised from the platform, called out whenever they engage in unwanted behaviour and removed from the platform.

The optimistic stance is that people can change over time, given the will and the right environment, and that the proportion of 'Those who do not see' will decrease within the more enlightened culture of public discourse that ScrutiNews wishes to promote.
