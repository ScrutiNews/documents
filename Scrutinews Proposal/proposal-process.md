#2. Proposal Process:

Slack: A slack 'workgroup' has been created to evaluate this proposal, please request an invite if you wish to be involved in these early discussions. The address is: https://scrutinews.slack.com/

a) Gauge Interest:
I will initially share this proposal amongst a few friends and colleagues whom I think would have a high-level interest in what I'm trying to achieve and whom I trust to give their honest and insightful feedback on the project proposal.

b) Technical Implementation Ideas:
Next, I will consult with technical colleagues to generate ideas on implementation details, and attempt to involve a group of core developers interested in forming a team to participate in the project.

c) Governance and Principles:
Make agreements amongst ourselves on how we'll tackle the project, identifying additional resources needed, determine who does what, how contributions are tracked, how we do governance.

d) Form a Strategy and Roadmap:
Solidify ideas on a business and revenue generation, funding, and think about a viable roadmap

e) White Paper:  Taking this proposal as the foundation for creating a formal white paper to guide our work and our philosophy.

f) Make a Start:
Build a fancy website to support the project and the ICO, and begin work on the prototype and a mini-application to track people's contributions.

Any of the above may change, remember this is just a proposal…
