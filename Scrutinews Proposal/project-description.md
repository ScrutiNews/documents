# 3. Project Description:

Coverage of news events, whether public interest or industry specific subjects, has become a minefield of unverified facts, sensationalism, bias, disinformation, fake news, and deliberately misleading clickbait headlines. This phenomenon occurs in both traditional news media and social media. Behind each headline there is usually an agenda. Someone is trying to influence your emotions and opinions, or manipulate you into clicking on an ad.

ScrutiNews is a news aggregator, utilising a cryptocurrency micropayments token to incentivise people to scrutinise and curate news feeds from multiple sources, discerning fact from fiction, highlighting bias and sensationalism, providing context and concise summaries, all to help the reader to keep abreast of current events from mainstream news and speacialised industry events. The best insights are filtered from the nonsense.

Readers will find trustable news summaries and critiques, relevant to their own interests, gaining timely and accurate insight and understanding. Those scrutinising and curating the news will be rewarded for their efforts based on the quality of their work, as acknowledged by the readers.

Potential ScrutiNews use cases are contrasted below, between those of mass public appeal and special interest use cases.


### 3.1 Use Case 1 - Traditional News Media and Social Media:
Over the last decade or so, there seems to have been increasing awareness amongst ordinary people of the inherent biases in reports from national news channels, newspapers, and associated websites. Mainstream media is often accused of slavishly repeating government PR, without question or scrutiny. Trust in mass media varies over time and by country, but a significant proportion of people are sceptical and distrustful of the quality and truthfulness of reporting. Some sources are more reliable than others of course, and some people are better at navigating to the truth than others. However, traditional media sources still hold much power to manipulate and cajole opinion, and many people are left bemused and confused by what is actually going on in the world.

Social media responds to the inherent ambiguities within traditional news media in a variety of ways. There are noble efforts to provide critique, facts, evidence, and truth, but there is also the amplification of prejudices. People gravitate to posts which confirm their biases, and become more deeply entrenched in their polarised positions. The wide accessibility of social media makes it prone to manipulation by malevolent actors, where fictions can be presented as truth in a believable way. The 'Fake News' phenomenon has arguable made some people a little more critical and sceptical of social media stories, however there are many who remain hoodwinked. Presented with such an overwhelming spectrum of 'information' many people are left bewildered and retreat to their familiar prejudices, rather than struggling to seek the truth.

### 3.2 Use Case 2 - Industry Specific & Special Interest News:
The business sector is rife with propaganda and general marketing 'bollocks'. News outlets do not want to risk their advertising revenues by being too negative towards companies who advertise with them. Companies will court journalists and lavish them with treats in return for favourable editorials. They'll launch all kinds of gimmicks for those vital column inches. Misreporting and deliberate malevolence are just as insidious in within Industry and Specialist news spheres as in the mainstream. People with are making business, investment, and political decisions on bogus and manipulated news reports. Industry and specialist news reports often tend to bubble up to mainstream reports, so mass media becomes an echo chamber, a regurgitation of bullshit. The need to strive for truth and reason in Industry and Special Interest news is just as important as in the mainstream news arena.

The first 'Industry News' sector we will use for prototyping the ScruitiNews platform for the CryptoAssets domain, as described in the next section. This will be a way of testing the platform with active tribe of users from whom we could expect both support and useful criticism so that refinements can be made before tackling the mass market.

### 3.3 CryptoAssets - Initial Use Case for the ScrutiNews Platform:
Industry News for CryptoAssets: Anyone who has followed the Cryptocurrency domain since the birth of Bitcoin will have seen countless unbalanced fearmongering articles from mainstream media countered by wildly exuberant claims from enthusiasts, leaving everyone clamouring for a sense of reality between the nonsense. Fake news has been spread to manipulate markets resulting in bouts of FOMO and FUD as panic within the crypto investor herds spreads like wildfire. 

A good example of the disinformation and shockingly poor journalism around Bitcoin, where the technology is presented in a series of one-sided slurs, is at https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoinobituaries/, a collection of articles declaring the death of Bitcoin since it's inception in 2009. Of course there is a barrage of over-inflated journalistic reports on the other side of the spectrum, the point of ScrutiNews is to seek an honest evaluation based on evidence and coherent argumentation.
As a cryptoasset enthusiast, I can keep up to date with breaking cryptoasset news to help me to better understand this fascinating and fast evolving domain, and make more timely and informed decisions when trading in cryptoassets. As a crypto 'Scrutineer', I get paid for filtering facts, anomalies, and prejudices from crypto news bulletins, adding value to readers.

#### CryptoAsset Product Vision Includes: 
The aim will be to create a platform, on which the cryptoassets news aggregator will be the first implementation.  
* Real-time news updates, sourced from news feeds, social media feeds, and user contributed feeds 
* Use of a cryptocurrency micro-payments token to create an internal economic system of payments, rewards, and incentives for quality of analysis and contributions 
* Feeds scrutinised and rated for trustworthiness 
* Multiple feeds consolidated into single stories, the day's events easily digestible 
* Stories linked to specific cryptoassets 
* User comments, voting and rewards, including predicted cryptoasset price impact analysis 
* Customisable alerts and notifications 
* Resources, journalistic summaries, and pearls of wisdom to aid understanding.

#### Delivery of the 'First Use Case': 
* Assemble a credible team 
* Build a basic application to track contributors inputs via a simple Ethereum smart contract. 
* Build the platform prototype 
* Hold a Token Generation Event (E.g. ICO initial Coin Offering), including roadmap, business plan, and whitepaper. 
* Launch the first use case, ScrutiNews for Cryptoassets 
* Promote like hell, and generate a revenue stream.
