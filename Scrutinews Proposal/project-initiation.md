# Project Initiation

This is a project in multiple stages, starting with collaboration to build a prototype.

I want to build the platform 'ScrutiNews', a news aggregator providing real-time news updates from multiple sources which are scrutinised and curated by specially trained 'Scrutineers' to weed out unreliable 'fake' reports and give context and analysis to reports.

The first implementation of ScrutiNews will be the \*world's best cryptoasset news aggregator, taking advantage of the current high levels of interest in this emerging field, and the copious amounts of bad reporting. Later implementations will extend the ScrutiNews platform to encompass other specialist industry news aggregation and curation. ScrutiNews will culminate in providing scrutiny, analysis and curation of mass media news, a field rife with misinformation and a chance to do something worthwhile for the progress of humanity. Early adopters of cryptocurrency are disproportionately the kind of people who sceptically question the authority of the mass media, and who will open-mindedly embrace the pursuit of truth and clarity in the public discourse.

*\*Currently the 'World's best cryptoasset news aggregator' seems to be https://cryptopanic.com - this has some nice features, but could be improved upon. It has some human curation via voting, but this can be a crude tool. Many of the sources are dubious.*

Why? When different people encounter a news article, each will form a different viewpoint, according to their 'reality tunnels', their unique way of experiencing the world. Their personal baggage of what they pay attention to, their filters, their prejudices, their lack of knowledge etc. ScrutiNews is a platform with tools and methodologies to scrutinise a news item, or any piece of content, distil it to its core elements, assess the accuracy and logic in its arguments and conclusions, and try to understand the whole spectrum of possible perspectives from which the item may be viewed.

The Internet gives us real-time information about world events, but it is in chaos, delivered to us by bad journalism, amplified by social media, distorting the truth and people's opinions. We've become polarised, entrenched in our prejudices, and at each otherâ€™s throats due to the faulty logic and ungrounded arguments in today's discourse. This is clearly evidenced by reader comments on articles, call in radio shows, and social media posts.

For the sake of my children and the world at large, this is the most purposeful and heroic challenge I can think of giving myself to is to inspire the creation of a means to apply rational scrutiny to the streams of information on current affairs, bringing order from chaos, to discern good journalism from bad, truth from misinformation and rumour, elevating the discourse to foster better solutions to the problems of the world.

This is a proposal for a collaborative project to build a News Scrutiny platform utilising a CryptoToken to create an internal system of payments and rewards for participants. Real time news updates, exposing bad journalism, celebrating good journalism, understanding the spectrum of perspectives, fact finding, and bringing clarity...

It is said that we're living in a 'post-truth era' where politicians and mass-media pick whatever 'facts' suit their agenda. And there are repressive regimes in the world where information is censored and manipulated to an Orwellian extent. Intelligent people are sick of this, let's give them something better.
