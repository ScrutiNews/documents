The beaten generation, the beaten generation
Reared on a diet of prejudice and misinformation
The beaten generation, the beaten generation
Open your eyes, open your imagination

## Summary:
This is a proposal to create a news aggregation platform, starting with a prototype for cryptocurrency news, where articles are filtered and scrutinised to weed out false claims and prejudice, giving the reader a version of events they can trust. This proposal speculates on how a news scrutiny platform could be viable, given currently available technologies and market sentiment, and how the project could be funded and fuelled by a cryptocurrency ICO (Initial Coin Offering).
