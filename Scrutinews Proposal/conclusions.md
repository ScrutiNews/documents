# 10. Conclusions:
I hope this proposal covers the essence of what I'm trying to achieve, in a motivating and sincere way. There may be many holes in the thinking and the plan may seem a little naïve or grandiose in parts, but what the hell, we're not here for ever so may as well go 'all-in' with something bold. If Elon Musk can make electric sports cars and fire off into space with re-usable rockets, then surely this isn't beyond the capabilities of a group of intelligent people, and enthusiastic backers, collaborating on something truly worthwhile...

#### Why do this? 
Important decisions are made every day upon the perceived truth of a situation. Despite information being more available to everyday people all over the world than it ever before, it is accompanied by vast increases in dis-information, propaganda, rumour and sensationalism.

People often lack the critical thinking skills to navigate through the nonsense, and find the truth for themselves. They end up with polarised false beliefs, which are stoked and reinforced by the media. This is dangerous, for individual welfare, the conviviality of society and the future of the world.

Undertaking a project to discern clarity and truth from the chaos and confusion pedalled by providers of information is arguably one of the noblest causes of our time. It's taking responsibility for the state of the word and our part in improving it for future generations. This is a very big 'why' which should be a huge motivation involved in those contributing and participating. 

#### Call to Action: 
This proposal talks about possibility and potential, but implies a call to action for people to participate, generate more ideas, and support it, so it becomes manifest.

#### John D's 'Why?': 
I was attracted to programming as a tool to make something brilliant, something worldimpacting. However, the reality has been to work on arguably trivial commercial products, of little importance in the progress of humanity or any other major project of personal self-fulfilment. Taking on traditional news media and social media is like simultaneously fighting a Leviathan and a Behemoth, but as mythology teaches us, the dragons are always guarding the gold, and the gold in this project would be the enourmous sense of pride and self-satisfaction from achieving something so meaningful.  I would like to find a way to make this project my full time job, and bring a few others along with me so that we could enjoy the satisfaction of working on something truly worthwhile, pulling journalism and online debate out of the gutter to elevate public discourse so collectively we make better decisions for the world we inhabit.

Damn, this all sounds a bit ambitious, but what the hell...
