# 7. Team:

ScrutiNews will be a collaborative effort, with some aspects completely open source.

#### What kind of Contributors Would the Project Need? 
* Skilled developers / project managers / business and marketing types 
* Blockchain / Crypto enthusiasts 
* People interested in current affairs, journalism, and the general state of the world 
* Academics, 'thought-leaders', or just intelligent and honest pursuers of knowledge - especially those involved in the scientific process, logic, critical thinking and argumentation, as well as political thinking and philosophy in its purest sense (love of knowledge). Those motivated by truth finding, free speech, and understanding the world as it is.
* Supporters â€“ People who love the idea of the project and want to follow from the sidelines, perhaps dipping in occasionally when they feel they have something to offer.

For Developers, this will be an opportunity to work with cutting edge technologies, create something unique and worthwhile, and own a slice of the action. The first project will be to create a lightweight and open-source 'Project Rewards Tool', as described below. This will be a useful way to 'try out' the approach to working as a team, as well as for many people our first exposure to the Ethereum platform (https://www.ethereum.org/) and Smart Contracts which will probably be written in Solidity (https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/).

#### Rewards for Developers and Other Contributors: 
An allocation will be made to participants of the project (e.g. Software development and associated activities) on a pre-agreed 'per contribution' basis.

As mentioned elsewhere in this proposal, one way of ensuring this is applied fairly would be to create a smart contract token (e.g. a DevToken using Ethereum) with an arbitrary supply (say 100,000) and use the supply to reward delivery of code or input of effort on a points basis (say 1 point of work = 10 tokens). Points and 'bounties' would be pre-agreed for all activities (Architecting, Design, Development, Code Review, QA, Project Management, Marketing etc...). DevTokens accrued during the pre-ICO phase will determine one's allocation of the ICO token when launched.

Code repositories have been created for building the Project Rewards Tool:
* API: https://github.com/ScrutiNews/project-rewards-api
* User Interface: https://github.com/ScrutiNews/project-rewards-ui
* Smart Contracts: https://github.com/ScrutiNews/project-rewards-contracts

A Trello board is set up to manage the tool development at: https://trello.com/scrutinews 
A slack channel #projects-rewards-tool has been created at https://scrutinews.slack.com
