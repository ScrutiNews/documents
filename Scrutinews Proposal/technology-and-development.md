# 5. Technology and Development:
### 5.1 Technology Stack Considerations:
a) Cryptocurrency Micropayments Token: 

* Use something like the Ethereum ERC-20 token for ICO and for the platform's economic eco-system? Whatever platform is chosen, it must be able to deal with micropayments as incentives, e.g. think of the Steemit blogging website and the STEEM currency. See https://steemit.com/ and https://steem.io/ 
* The first thing to tackle would be the creation of a basic application to track contributors inputs via a simple Ethereum Smart Contract. This would be conceived as a fair way to track individual inputs into the project so that rewards, such as the allocation of tokens between the team following the ICO, can be dealt with fairly and transparently. 

b) A Decentralised Platform: 

* Consider practicalities and benefits of building the whole platform as a Decentralised Application (dApp) vs a traditional Centralised platform using the likes of PHP (E.g. Laravel Lumen 'API first' approach or NodeJS) and JavaScript based front-end (e.g. Vue / React). Perhaps the pre-ICO prototype would be centralised, with a plan to move to a decentralised model once dApps technology matures?
* Consider IPFS (Inter-Planetary File System) for distributed, permanent, high performance file storage management with no single point of failure. The Platform could be data heavy (e.g. storage of all feed inputs, Scrutineer and user activity around news feeds). Selection of the best database storage and retrieval solutions would be of paramount importance. Note that a dApp built with IPFS could avoid censorship by repressive regimes, because arguably the need for a news Scrutineering app is a 'life or death' issue in oppressive countries.

c) Marketing website for project and ICO launch. 

* The expectation is usually a single page app website, very fancy, very slick. For examples, see the websites for forthcoming ICOs - https://tokenmarket.net/ico-calendar/upcoming  

### 5.2 Collaboration and PR Tools:
A common range of on-line tools are typically used by projects in the cryptocurrency sphere:
* GitHub for collaboration and version control: https://github.com/ScrutiNews 
* A lightweight development project management tool to manage work into individual 'sprintable' project boards. A Trello Team has been created at - https://trello.com/scrutinews 
* Slack for collaboration and chat. Already created at - https://scrutinews.slack.com/ 
* Telegram for ICO PR and chat 
* A well managed and frequently updated Reddit channel for community building
